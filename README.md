# HANDAL Dataset

Dataset is now available for manual [download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ANTZAXDbZbszyxa7ZO9_DcFHe8tbdCIN?usp=drive_link).  Automated tools are forthcoming...

Dataset follows the [BOP format](https://github.com/thodan/bop_toolkit/blob/master/docs/bop_datasets_format.md), with some minor modifications:
- Image size is provided in the info file (since multiple camera sensors were used to capture data)
- Depth is from NeRF ([Instant NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp)) rather than from a depth sensor

*(Note:  Not all categories are available yet.  Some are uploading, others are still processing.  Stay tuned over the next several days...)*

For more details (including the IROS '23 paper describing the work), see the [project page](https://nvlabs.github.io/HANDAL)

Code for re-creating the dataset will be coming in a few weeks...
